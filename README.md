# EdgeSide

EdgeSide is a framework for edge-side integration built on the Cloudflare Workers platform.

The main use case is for integrating dynamic data from external services into the pages of a website which is otherwise static or generated by a Content Management System (CMS).

The framework runs a 'template engine' at the edge (on Cloudflare nodes) which can inject dynamic data from services into static templates provides by the CMS.

For simple uses very little code or configuration is required in the Cloudflare worker -- the behaviour of the framework is defined by html script elements provided by the origin (the CMS).

## Documentation and examples

The [documentation site](https://docs.edgeside.org) is a static html site which is powered by the framework. It includes numerous live examples of the framework in action.

## NPM package

You can add the EdgeSide framework to an existing Cloudflare Worker like this:

```
npm install edgeside
```
## Getting started
